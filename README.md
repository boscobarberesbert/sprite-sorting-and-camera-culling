# Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling

## About me

I am [Bosco Barber Esbert](https://es.linkedin.com/in/bosco-barber-esbert-b13876201), student of the [Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/grau-videojocs-bcn/) by [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/en) at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project II, under supervision of the lecturer [Ramón Santamaría](https://es.linkedin.com/in/raysan).

## About the project

This project contains a research about the optimization of a game to only blit tiles and sprites that are on the camera viewport. Also, it is about sorting entities to make a feeling of depth in top-down and isometric games. Contains an integration of Tiled into SDL.

In my [website](https://www.boscodev.com/sprite-sorting-and-camera-culling/) you will find information about Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling and how to implement them in your project. You can also visit the [main GitHub repository page](https://github.com/boscobarberesbert/sprite-sorting-and-camera-culling) where you will be able to find two Visual Studio projects, one with the Sprite Sorting and Camera Culling systems fully implemented and another one with some parts missing to help you practice.

This research will solve the following questions and provide help to implement them in your code:
* Do you want to change manually all your code every time you want to print something in a different order or you prefer an automatic method?
* It's necessary to print every tile, entity, object, particle or any other element that isn't seen on the screen?
* If I have two entities, one in each side of the screen, do you want to check if they are colliding? What if you have thousands of entities?
* This is the most important question: Do you want your game (or program) to run faster?

Now that you know that these topics are actually very important for a game to be optimized, you van visit my [webpage](https://www.boscodev.com/sprite-sorting-and-camera-culling/) where I explain them more in depth and give you a focused guide on how to implement these techniques in your code.
